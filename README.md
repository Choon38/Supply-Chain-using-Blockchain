Developed a Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management system to ensure transparency, traceability, and efficiency in product movement across the supply chain. The system leverages blockchain technology to securely record and track transactions at every stage, from procurement to final delivery, ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud. Key features include smart contracts for automating processes, real-time status updates, and immutable records for better accountability. Tools like Remix IDE and Ethereum were used to create and deploy smart contracts. The project demonstrated the potential of blockchain to enhance trust and streamline supply chain operations.
